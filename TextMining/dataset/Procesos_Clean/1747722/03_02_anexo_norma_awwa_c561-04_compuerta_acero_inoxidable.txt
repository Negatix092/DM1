actuate slide gate occurs during the unseating and raising the weight the slide closing normally the downward motion the gate the weight the stem and slide act the direction motion and reduce the force required the force required actuate the slide part empirically determined the force may calculated shown below for design purposes the force should not taken less than per lineal inch gate opening height metric where total maximum force required open slide friction factor slide against seat area gate opening head water gate centerline weight slide weight stem the friction factor between the slide and the seats may taken for uhmwpe seats appropriate changes opening force calculations bearing pressure and friction factor must made seals separate from the seats are utilized the weight
