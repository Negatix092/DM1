Foreword
This foreword is for information only and is not a part of AWWA C561.
I. Introduction.
I.A. Background. A slide gate is a single-faced valve consisting of an open
frame and a slide. Examples of where this type of “valve” is used include controlling
flow at openings in tank walls and at ends of pipes. The term slide gate has been
adopted for use by this series of standards, which supersede AWWA C501-92. The
standards are
C560—Cast Metal Slide Gates
C561—Fabricated Stainless Steel Slide Gates
C562—Fabricated Aluminum Slide Gates
C563—Fabricated Nonmetal Slide Gates
Other terms used to describe single-faced valves include penstocks and sluice gates.
These gates are raised and lowered by means of a stem or rod, usually manually
actuated or power-actuated hoists.
The slide gates represented by the C-560 through C-563 series differ in material
and in the means of sealing between the slide and the fixed frame.
C560 gates have a cast-metal slide and frame with machined metal seating faces
and wedges to force the slide to seal between the seating faces on the slide and frame.
C561 gates have a fabricated, reinforced stainless steel slide and frame with ultra
high molecular weight (UHMW) polyethylene seating faces.
C562 gates have a fabricated, reinforced aluminum slide and frame with
UHMW polyethylene seating faces.
C563 gates have a fiberglass reinforced composite plastic or rigid compressed
plastic slide and fiberglass reinforced composite plastic or stainless steel frame with
UHMW polyethylene seating faces.
I.B. History. The original AWWA standard for slide gates (then referred to as
sluice gates) was approved as tentative in June 1941 and described cast-iron gates.
The tentative standard was revised and approved in 1967 as AWWA Standard C501.
Subsequent editions were approved in January 1980, June 1987, and June 1992.
Following the latest revision, the Standards Council authorized the development of
additional standards for slide gates to recognize the widespread use of slide gates
similar to C501 gates in performance but manufactured by different methods and of

requirements more stringent than those required by the state. To evaluate the health
effects of products and drinking water additives from such products, state and local
agencies may use various references, including
1. An advisory program formerly administered by USEPA, Office of Drinking
Water, discontinued on April 7, 1990.
2. Specific policies of the state or local agency.
Two standards developed under the direction of NSF, ANSI†/NSF‡60, Drinking
Water Treatment Chemicals—Health Effects, and ANSI/NSF 61, Drinking Water
System Components—Health Effects.
Other references, including AWWA standards, Food Chemicals Codex, Water
Chemical Codex,§ and other standards considered appropriate by the state or local
agency.

different materials. For consistency among the new standards and recognizing the
new designs employed, the Standards Council directed that all of the standards use
the name “slide gate” in lieu of the term “sluice gate.” The Standards Council also
directed that C501 be redesignated C560, with subsequent slide gate standards
numbered consecutively. This is the first edition of C561, Standard for Fabricated
Stainless-Steel Slide Gates, and was approved on Jan. __, 2004.
I.C. Acceptance. In May 1985, the US Environmental Protection Agency
(USEPA) entered into a cooperative agreement with a consortium led by NSF
International (NSF) to develop voluntary third-party consensus standards and a
certification program for all direct and indirect drinking water additives. Other
members of the original consortium included the American Water Works Association
Research Foundation (AWWARF) and the Conference of State Health and
Environmental Managers (COSHEM). The American Water Works Association
(AWWA) and the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators (ASDWA)
joined later.
In the United States, authority to regulate products for use in, or in contact with,
drinking water rests with individual states.* Local agencies may choose to impose

Various certification organizations may be involved in certifying products in
accordance with ANSI/NSF 61. Individual states or local agencies have authority to
accept or accredit certification organizations within their jurisdiction. Accreditation
of certification organizations may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
Annex A, “Toxicology Review and Evaluation Procedures,” to ANSI/NSF 61
does not stipulate a maximum allowable level (MAL) of a contaminant for substances
not regulated by USEPA final maximum contaminant level (MCL). The MALs of an
unspecified list of “unregulated contaminants” are based on toxicity testing guidelines
(noncarcinogens) and risk characterization methodology (carcinogens). Use of Annex
A Procedures may not always be identical, depending on the certifier.
AWWA C561 does not address additives requirements. Thus, users of this
standard should consult the appropriate state and local agency having jurisdiction in
order to
1. Determine additive requirements, including applicable standards.
2. Determine the status of certifications by all parties offering to certify products
for contact with, or treatment of, drinking water.
3. Determine current information on product certification.
II. Special Issues. In creating this standard, the committee initially drafted a
standard governing a slide gate design with an integral seat–seal system utilizing
ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene as the resilient material providing the seat
and seal. This design and material, it was felt, offered the widest application to the
water industry, particularly to high head applications and those applications subject
to abrasive conditions. However, an older gate design utilizing a resilient seal separate
from the seat has been in use for a number of years and performs well. Accordingly,
this standard was broadened to include the older design with a seal separate from the
seat. The purchaser is urged to consult with the manufacturers on the application of
the different slide gate designs to the particular application.
III. Use of This Standard. It is the responsibility of the user of an AWWA
standard to determine that the products described in that standard are suitable for use
in the particular application being considered.
III.A. Purchaser Options and Alternatives. The following items should be
covered in the purchaser’s specifications:
1. Standard used—that is, AWWA C561, Standard for Fabricated Stainless
Steel Slide Gates, of latest revision.
2. Number of units required.

3. Size and type of closure—conventional or flush-bottom.
4. Any drawings and material specifications required of the supplier or of the
manufacturer (Sec. 4.1 and 4.2).
5. If test records must be viewed (Sec. 4.3.2).
6. Acceptable materials (Sec. 4.3.3).
7. Design head measured from the surface of water to centerline of gate, in feet
(meters), for the following:
a. Seating head
b. Unseating head
8. Operating head measured from surface of water to centerline of gate, in feet
(meters).
9. Type of gate mounting used: If a wall thimble is used, required length and
shape (Sec. 4.4.10).
10. If seals, separate from seats, are to be provided (Sec. 4.3.3.8 and 4.4.3).
11. Rising stem or nonrising stem (Sec. 4.4.7 and 4.4.11).
12. Type of actuator—manual, electric-motor-driven, or hydraulic-cylinder. If
electric-motor or hydraulic-cylinder, the purchaser should refer to ANSI/AWWA
C540, Standard for Power-Actuating Devices for Valves and Slide Gates.
13. If hydraulic or pneumatic actuators are specified, provide cylinder operating
media and pressure (refer to ANSI/AWWA C540).
14. Omission of stem covers if not required (Sec. 4.4.13.6).
15. If a gate position indicator is to be provided with the actuator (Sec. 4.4.13.7).
16. Weld inspections, if required (Sec. 4.5.2.2).
17. Inspection by purchaser, if required (Sec. 5.1).
18. Leakage tests in the shop (Sec. 5.2.1) and in the field (Sec. 5.2.2), if required.
19. Separate shipment of embedded items, if required (Sec. 6.2).
20. Affidavit of compliance, if required (Sec. 6.3).
21. Definition of any special design and construction required for conditions
beyond the scope of this standard, such as throttling service or downward acting gates,
including intended operation frequency and duration.
22. Frequency of operation and special operating conditions, such as ice
formation.
23. An installation-requirement drawing showing clearances, wall to floor thicknesses, details of wall pipe and thimble installation, and location of actuator.

4.5.3.3 Coating. After cleaning, the surfaces to be coated shall be primed
and finished in the manufacturer’s shop with a high-solids epoxy coating or
equivalent.
4.5.3.4 Stainless steel cleaning. Stainless steel does not require protective
coatings for corrosion resistance, and protective coatings are generally not recommended. All stainless steel parts shall be cleaned and free of grease and dirt, and all
stainless steel weldments shall be cleaned and free of slag, weld spatter, and heat tint
discoloration.

Sec. 4.6

Installation
Handle, store, and install the wall thimble or other connection device, gate,
actuator mechanism, stem, stem guides, and accessories in accordance with the
manufacturer’s drawings and recommendations. Care shall be taken to avoid warping
the gate frame and to maintain tolerances between seating faces. All gates, thimbles,
stems, and actuators shall be plumbed, shimmed, and aligned accurately.
4.6.1 Hole protection. Tapped holes in thimbles shall be plugged for
protection.
4.6.2 Surface protection. During construction, the surfaces of the connecting device, wall thimble, gate, actuators, and appurtenances shall be covered or
otherwise protected from concrete spillage, paint, oil, and debris. Any damage that
occurs to the connecting device or gate in storage or handling shall be corrected prior
to installation of the gate or operating and testing the gate.
4.6.3 Thimble. Thimbles shall be positioned accurately and supported to
prevent shifting during the pouring of the surrounding concrete. Thimbles shall be
carefully braced both horizontally and vertically to prevent distortion. Concrete shall
be poured carefully to provide a good bond to the thimble without voids. Concrete
shall be forced under the thimble up to the air-vent holes.
4.6.4 Slide. After actuated gates have been completely installed, adjusted,
and properly lubricated, each slide shall be operated for one complete cycle, openclose-open or close-open-close.
4.6.5 Switch setting. After installation of gates with electric motor actuators,
torque switches shall be adjusted and limit switches set according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations. The gate shall then be operated through one
complete cycle, open-close-open or close-open-close.

4.6.6 Actuator storage. If hydraulic–cylinder actuators are to be stored at the
jobsite for one month or longer, the cylinders shall be filled with oil at the storage
site. If oil-filled cylinders are stored horizontally, they shall be rotated at least once
per month. If electric actuators are to be stored at the jobsite for one month or
longer, provisions shall be made to energize the electrical enclosure strip heaters.
4.6.7 Cylinder. After installation of gates with hydraulic-cylinder actuators,
the alignment of the cylinder with the gate shall be checked by opening the gate
before water is turned into the gate chamber. Binding or side thrust on the cylinder
rod shall be eliminated to ensure proper cylinder operation and long life of seals. All
connections shall be carefully checked for leaks. After proper alignment has been
obtained and absence of leaks assured, the gate, submerged or subjected to normal
operating heads, shall be checked through another complete cycle of operation, openclose-open, or close-open-close.

5.2.2 Field leakage test. A field leakage test may be performed by the
purchaser after installation of the slide gate. The manufacturer shall be notified of the
test so as to allow sufficient time to enable a representative of the manufacturer to be
present at the test site. After all adjustments have been made and the mechanism
properly lubricated, each gate slide shall be operated through one complete cycle as a
final check on proper operation before starting the leakage test. Seating and unseating
heads shall be measured from the top surface of the water to the center of the gate.
5.2.2.1 Head. Under the design head, seating or unseating, as specified, the
leakage shall not exceed 0.10 gpm/ft (1.24 lpm/m) of seating perimeter.

APPENDIX A
Force Required to Actuate Fabricated Stainless Steel Gates

The maximum force required to actuate a slide gate occurs during the unseating
and raising of the weight of the slide. In closing, normally the downward motion of
the gate, the weight of the stem and slide act in the direction of motion and reduce
the force required.
The force required to actuate the slide is, in part, empirically determined. The
force may be calculated as shown below. For design purposes, the force should not be
taken as less than 50 lb per lineal inch of gate opening height.
F = 62.4 × f × A × H + 1.5 × P1 + P2
([metric] F = 1,000 × f × A × H + 1.5 × P1 + P2)
Where:
F = total maximum force required to open slide, lb (N)
f = friction factor of slide against seat
A = area of gate opening, ft2 (m2)
H = head of water at gate centerline, ft (m)
P1 = weight of slide, lb (kg)
P2 = weight of stem, lb (kg)
The friction factor f between the slide and the seats may be taken as 0.20 for
UHMW-PE seats. Appropriate changes in opening force calculations (bearing
pressure and friction factor) must be made if seals, separate from the seats, are
utilized. The weight of the stem and slide should be obtained from the manufacturer
of the gate. It has not been general practice to reduce the weight of the slide or stem
because of the buoyant effect of the water.
The force required to overcome the frictional effect of the wedges is accounted
for by empirically assigning one half of the weight of the slide to the opening force.

On partially opened parallel closure gates and on wedge type gates, after release
from the wedges, the force becomes
F1 = 62.4 × f × A × H + P1 + P2 + P3
([metric] F1 = 1,000 × f × A × H + P1 + P2 + P3)
Where:
F1 = total maximum force required for sustained effort on the actuator, lb (kg)
P3 = 62.4 × H × a × c, lb
([metric] P3 = 1,000 × H × a × c, N)
Where:
a = cross sectional area of gate slide (gate width x bottom rib plan
dimension), ft2 (m2)
c = coefficient
P3 accounts for the downpull force caused by the flow velocity when the gate is
slightly open. It is significant only on large gates and higher heads. The coefficient
varies with the shape of the gate lip. The c coefficient can range from less than 0 to
more than 1.0.
The above forces are based on the use of a handwheel, crank, or electric-motoractuated gate where the lift nut turns around a threaded rising stem or where the
threaded stem turns inside a thrust nut on nonrising stem applications.
When cylinder actuators are employed, it is suggested that the total forces
calculated above are to be multiplied by a 1.3 safety factor when starting the gate
from closed to open.
